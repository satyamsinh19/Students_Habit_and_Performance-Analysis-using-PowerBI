<h1 align="center">📊 Student Habits & Academic Performance Analysis</h1>


---

## 🧠 Introduction

In the modern educational landscape, a student's academic performance is influenced by much more than just classroom instruction. Factors such as sleep patterns, diet, internet accessibility, parental education, and participation in co-curricular activities all play crucial roles in shaping a student’s success and mental health.

This project presents a detailed analysis of lifestyle and behavioral patterns of **1000 students**, using Power BI to visually explore how these habits correlate with academic grades and mental wellness. The insights derived aim to guide educators, parents, and students in making informed decisions to enhance learning outcomes.
